# DSA Practice: Array to Linked List

This repository contains my solutions for DSA problems covering **Array, String, and Linked List** topics. Each problem includes:
- Brute-force and optimized solutions (whenever possible)
- Well-documented code with clear comments
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Folder structure for topic-wise organization
- Daily commits, showcasing consistent sincerity and practice


## üìù Practice Workflow
1. **Problem Statement:** Each file begins with a comment containing the problem's description and a LeetCode reference link.
2. **Logic Explanation:** Step-by-step comments explain the reasoning behind solutions.
3. **Complexity Analysis:** Time and space complexity are noted in each file.
4. **Daily GitHub Activity:** Solutions and improvements are uploaded daily for sincerity assessment.

## ‚ö° Solution Approach
- For each question, both brute-force and optimized solutions are provided whenever possible.
- Clean code style: meaningful variable names, proper indentation, no redundant code.

## üìí DSA Practice Notebook
A personal digital (or hardcopy) notebook is maintained containing:
- Problem statement
- Step-by-step logic
- Complexity analysis
- Final code summary and learnings

## üöÄ Usage
1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/rjm23014/G1_Assignment_rjm

2. Navigate to topic folder (e.g., `Array/`), pick a problem, and review solutions.
3. Refer to LeetCode links for additional practice and discussion.

## üè∑Ô∏è Naming Conventions
- `Array/ProblemName_BruteForce.cpp`
- `Array/ProblemName_Optimized.cpp`
- `String/ProblemName_BruteForce.cpp` & `String/ProblemName_Optimized.cpp`
- `LinkedList/ProblemName_BruteForce.cpp` & `LinkedList/ProblemName_Optimized.cpp`

## üìö Reference Links
- LeetCode problem URLs included at the top of each solution file.
